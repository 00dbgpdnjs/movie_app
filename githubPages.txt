1. Check a "build" script in package.json
    If running  scripts, our website create production ready code
        production ready: The code is compressed and everything is optimized.
    (After $ npm run build, "build" folder is created) - It now become pre-cmd

2. Create a repo on github
    Do getSetup.txt in movieql dir

    * RepoName
    $ git remote -v
    >> origin https://github.com/username/reopName (fetch)
        origin https://github.com/username/reopName (push)

3.bottom part of package.json
    },
    "homepage":"https://githubUsername.github.io/githubRepoName"

4. Add "deploy" scripts
    "deploy":"gh-pages -d build"
    This script run gh-pages and get "build" dir. gh-pages upload build folder to "homepage"

    And then add predeploy cmd
        "predeploy":"npm run build"

    $ npm run deploy âœ…
        - Include $ npm run build   

5. Click "homepage"'s link. There's 404 cuz the update takes 5m

6. If modifying or updating, run $ npm run deploy
    Then the project is built auto and the result's folder is pushed to github pages
